I am a software engineer based in the Boston area. I love writing code, but for
code to be meaningful it needs to improve the lives of real people. On the more
technical side I care a lot about the "developer experience" â€” the intersection
of people and code. I like to think about abstractions and how they can make
code easier to reason about (from how you name your variables all the way to the
design of programming languages).

I also enjoy reading, biking, rock climbing, and playing guitar.
