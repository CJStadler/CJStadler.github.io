I am a software engineer in Boston. I want to write fast, secure, and reliable
programs, and make it easier for everyone to do so as well. I like to think
about programming languages and other kinds of abstractions that enable this.

My github: [CJStadler](https://github.com/CJStadler)

I also enjoy running and climbing plastic rocks.
